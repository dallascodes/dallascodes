- 👋 Hi, I’m @dallascodes, a Brazilian student!
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end development and User Centered Design (UX)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Grafic Design, so I'll be able to level up for UX while still learning to code :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any front-end project where I can use my creativity and develop my skills
- 📫 How to reach me... Right here! Or send a sup on my Instagram: @dallxlana22
